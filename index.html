All clergy had a rank in the hierarchy, from priests to bishops, archbishops, to the pope.<br>The Church's sacraments marked all the most important occasions of life from birth to death. Many people expressed their fate by going on pilgrimages or fighting in the Crusades.</p>

        <h2 id="2">Life in a Medieval Village</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In medieval society, most people lived in villages and most of the population were peasants. Villeins were peasants legally tied to land owned by a locla lord. If they wanted to move, or even get married, they needed the permission of the lord first. In return for being allowed to farm land they lived on, villeins worked on strips of land, spread out in different fields across the village.<br>Life could be hard; if crops failed to produceenough food, people faced starvation.<br>Some peasants were called freemen. These peasants were able to move round from one village to another and did not have the same restrictions on them as villeins did.</p>

        <h2 id="3">Technology and Scientific Development</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The Middle Ages was a period of great innovation and progress in Europe and the Islamic World.<br>
        Some of the most important inventions in Europe include the printing press and the heavy plows.<br>
        The printing press would wrench control of information distribution from the State and the Church and lay the groundwork for the Protestant Reformationand the Enlightenment.<br>The heavy plows, instead, made it possibleto plow areas with clay soil.This led to economic growth and the rapid growth of cities and trade.<br>In the Islamic World, chemistry formed an important part of other industries such as metal-working and ceramic manufacture. Not only did islamic scientists invent important methods such as distillation but also were the first to describe the properties of acids and alkalis.</p>

        <h2 id="4">Crime and Punishment</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In medieval Europe, many crimes were met with creul and painful punishments.<br>In England, outlaws would have to have been proven guilty before being punished. This was done through ordeals, tests that would prove wether someone was guilty or not. Failing such tests would lead to the criminals' punishments.<br>Punishments would vary from crime to crime. For example, if a thief was caught, their hands would be cut off, but if somone was found guilty of high treason, they would be hung, drawn and quartered instead.<br>In the Islamic world, execution wasn't uncommon. In fact, in the Islamic criminal law apostasy, blasphemy, illegal sexual intercourse, and intentional homocide were all punishable by death.</p>

The Black Death killed an estimated 25-30 million people.<br>The disease originated in Central Asia and was taken to the Crimea by Mongol warriors and traders. The plague quickly spread across Europe and around 30% of the population of affected areas was killed.<br>The consequences of such a large number of deaths were severe, and in many places, the social structure of society broke down.
